## Introduction

grblHAL is a 32-bit CNC motion control firmware based on the original grbl project. It features a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) design that allows it to run on various microcontrollers while maintaining consistent core functionality. This guide covers how to establish communication between your computer and grblHAL-powered controller.

**Key Features:**
- Support for multiple communication methods (USB, Ethernet, Wireless)
- Compatible with various GCode senders
- Real-time machine control and monitoring
- Advanced probing and tool change capabilities

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **Controller Board**: grblHAL-compatible board (GRBLHAL2000, Flexi-HAL, PicoCNC, etc.)
- **Computer**: Windows, macOS, or Linux with available USB/Ethernet ports
- **Cables**: USB Type-A to Type-B cable OR Ethernet cable (depending on connection method)

### Software Requirements
- **GCode Sender**: ioSender (recommended), OpenBuilds CONTROL, LaserGRBL, or Universal Gcode Sender
- **USB Drivers**: CH340, CP2102, or FTDI drivers (depending on your board)
- **Terminal Software** (optional): PuTTY, Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, or similar

---

## Connection Methods

grblHAL supports multiple communication methods:

### 1. USB Serial (Most Common)
- **Pros**: Simple setup, powers the board, no network configuration
- **Cons**: Susceptible to EMI, limited cable length
- **Use Case**: Initial setup, testing, basic operation

### 2. Ethernet (Recommended for Production)
- **Pros**: EMI resistant, longer cable runs, reliable protocol with error checking
- **Cons**: Requires network configuration, board must be powered separately
- **Use Case**: Production environments, machines with spindles/VFDs

### 3. WiFi (Board Dependent)
- **Pros**: Wireless convenience
- **Cons**: Potential interference, latency concerns
- **Use Case**: Specific applications where wired connections aren't feasible

## USB Serial Communication Setup

### Step 1: Install USB Drivers

Most grblHAL boards use one of these USB-to-Serial chips:

#### CH340/CH341 Driver
1. Download from manufacturer or search "CH340 Arduino driver"
2. Run installer as administrator
3. Restart computer if prompted

#### CP2102/CP2104 Driver (Silicon Labs)
1. Download from Silicon Labs website
2. Install using the provided installer
3. Verify installation in Device Manager

#### FTDI Driver
1. Download from FTDI website
2. Install according to FTDI instructions

### Step 2: Connect Hardware
1. Connect USB Type-A to Type-B cable between computer and grblHAL board
2. Power on the controller board
3. Verify connection in Device Manager (Windows) or System Information (macOS)

### Step 3: Identify COM Port

#### Windows
1. Open **Device Manager**
2. Expand **Ports (COM & LPT)**
3. Look for entries like:
   - "USB-SERIAL CH340"
   - "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge"
   - "USB Serial Device"
4. Note the COM port number (e.g., COM3, COM7)

#### macOS/Linux
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `ls /dev/tty.*` or `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`
3. Look for device names like `/dev/tty.usbserial-*` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`

### Step 4: Configure Connection Settings

**Standard grblHAL Serial Parameters:**
- **Baud Rate**: 115200 (default)
- **Data Bits**: 8
- **Parity**: None
- **Stop Bits**: 1
- **Flow Control**: None

## Ethernet Communication Setup

### Step 1: Enable Ethernet in Firmware

If your board supports Ethernet but firmware doesn't have it enabled:

1. Visit the [grblHAL Web Builder](https://github.com/grblHAL/core/discussions/203)
2. Select your board type
3. Go to **Networking** tab
4. Enable:
   - Ethernet (select appropriate module: WIZ550io, WIZ850io, etc.)
   - Telnet server
   - WebSocket server
   - FTP server (optional)
5. Generate and download firmware
6. Flash new firmware to your board

### Step 2: Physical Connection

#### Direct Connection (Recommended)
1. Connect Ethernet cable directly between computer and grblHAL board
2. No router or switch required

#### Router/Switch Connection
1. Connect both computer and grblHAL board to same network
2. Ensure they can communicate on the same subnet

### Step 3: Network Configuration

#### Option A: DHCP (Dynamic IP)
1. Set grblHAL to DHCP mode: `$301=1`
2. Controller will automatically receive IP address
3. Find IP address using `$I` command or check router admin panel

#### Option B: Static IP (Recommended)
1. Set grblHAL to static mode: `$301=0`
2. Configure static IP: `$302=192.168.5.1` (example)
3. Set subnet mask: `$303=255.255.255.0`
4. Set gateway: `$304=192.168.5.254` (if needed)

#### Computer Network Settings (for Direct Connection)
**Windows:**
1. Open **Network & Internet Settings**
2. Go to **Ethernet** → **Change adapter options**
3. Right-click ethernet adapter → **Properties**
4. Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** → **Properties**
5. Set:
   - IP Address: `192.168.5.2`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
   - Default Gateway: (leave blank for direct connection)

### Step 4: Test Connection
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Ping the grblHAL board: `ping 192.168.5.1`
3. If successful, proceed to connect with GCode sender
